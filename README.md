# JavaScript Asynchronous Concepts

## Overview

This project provides a blog-like HTML page that explains key asynchronous concepts in JavaScript. It includes detailed explanations and code examples for the following topics:

- JavaScript Async
- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/Await
- Event Loop

The page is styled with custom CSS and demonstrates how asynchronous code is executed in JavaScript. The code examples include expected console outputs to help understand the behavior of each concept.

## Features

- **JavaScript Async**: Explanation and example of asynchronous JavaScript using `setTimeout`.
- **Callback**: Explanation and example of using callbacks for asynchronous operations.
- **Promise**: Explanation and example of Promises, including `.then` and `.catch`.
